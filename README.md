# Crypto Tracker

Used React.js and CoinGecko API to build an app to track the coin prices in real time.
A section for currently trending coins and an input for search.
When a coin is clicked it redirects to a personal page with some additional information to that coin.

## Dependencies and packages:

* SCSS
* Axios
* CoinGecko API
* React-Router
* React-Icons

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
